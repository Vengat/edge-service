# edge-service
<h3>This is an edge service prototype</h3>

<h4>A route is defined by the following:</h4>

<p>Predicates, which select a route based on information in the incoming HTTP request</p>

<p>Filters, which can modify both the request and/or the response</p>
<p>A destination URI, which describes where to send a request</p>
<p>An ID, that is, the name of the route</p>
<p>For a full list of available predicates and filters, refer to the reference documentation: https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/single/spring-cloud-gateway.html.</p>
